Whether you're the buyer or the seller or even refinancing, you're going to have closing costs. If you're the buyer, your mortgage closing costs account for about 2%-5% of the purchase price. If you're the seller, about 6% of the sales price will go toward paying realtor fees.</p><h2 style="font-size:120%;color:#1e90ff">Can I Roll Closing Costs into the Loan?</h2><p>Typically, the only loan that allows you to include the closing costs into the mortgage is a USDA loan.</p><p>Home loans have a loan-to-value ratio (LTV ratios) that puts a cap on how much you can include in the loan. This is calculated by taking your loan amount plus the closing costs and then subtracting the down payment. The number you're left with must not exceed the LTV limit for that specific loan.</p><p>The only exception to the LTV ratio rule are USDA loans. You can include your closing costs into a USDA loan just as long as your property appraises for more than the sales price.</p></div></div></section><div class="banner dark-cerulean font-large" id="cc-ss"><h2 class="slide showing">Loan Origination Fee</h2><h2 class="slide">Escrow Fees</h2><h2 class="slide">Upfront MIP</h2><h2 class="slide">VA Funding Fee</h2><h2 class="slide">Title Insurance</h2><h2 class="slide">Taxes & Pre-Paid</h2></div><section><div class="main flex-center"><div class="col-6 col-s-6"><!-- What's Included in My Closing Costs? --------------------><div class="card-header">What’s Included in My Closing Costs?</div><div class="card-body"><p>The following is not an exhaustive list, and the amounts will vary.

One way to entice them to pay your fees is to offer to buy the home for a higher purchase price if they agree to pay for some of your costs.</p><p>You may be wondering if this is actually worth, but consider this: increasing your offer by $6000 in exchange for them paying $6000 in your closing fees amounts to only a few extra dollars a month in your mortgage payment. If you're looking for a way to save on your fees upfront, this is how you want to do it.</p><p>Note that each type of loan has a max as to how much the seller can contribute to your closing costs.</p></div></div><div class="col-6 col-s-6"><div class="card-header">Seller Contribution Limit</div><div class="card-body"><!-- Conventional Loans ----------------------------------><p>1. <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/content/guide/selling/b3/4.1/02.html" target="_blank">CONVENTIONAL</a> - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the two rule makers for conventional loans. They set maximum seller-paid closing costs that are different from other loan types such as FHA and VA. While seller-paid cost amounts are capped, the limits are very generous.</p><table style="background-color:#fff;color:#000"><tr><th>Property Type</th><th>Down Payment</th><th>Maximum Seller Contribution</th></tr><tr><td>Primary residence or 2nd home</td><td>Less than 10%</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Primary residence or 2nd home</td><td>10% - 25%</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Primary residence or 2nd home</td><td>25% or more</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Property</td><td>Any Amount</td><td>2%</td></tr></table><!-- FHA Loans -------------------------------------------><p>2. <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/4155-1_2_SECA.PDF" target="_blank">FHA Loan</a> - The seller and other interested parties can contribute up to 6% of the sales price or toward closing costs, prepaid expenses, discount points, and other financing concessions. If the appraised home value is less than the purchase price, the seller may still contribute 6% of the value.</p><!-- VA Loans --------------------------------------------><p>3. <a href="https://www.benefits.va.gov/WARMS/docs/admin26/handbook/ChapterLendersHanbookChapter8.pdf" target="_blank">VA Loan</a> - The seller may contribute up to 4% of the sale price, plus reasonable and customary loan costs on VA home loans. Total contributions may exceed 4% because standard closing costs do not count toward the total.</p><p>According to VA guidelines, the 4% rule only applies to items such as:</p><ul><li>Prepayment of property taxes and insurance</li><li>Appliances and other gifts from the builder</li><li>Discount points above 2% of the loan amount</li><li>Payoff of the buyer’s judgments and debts</li><li>Payment of the VA funding fee</li></ul><p>For example, a buyer’s core closing costs for things like appraisal, loan origination, and the title equal 2% of the purchase price. The seller agrees to prepay taxes, insurance, the VA funding fee, and a credit card balance equal to 3% of the sales price.</p><p>This 5% contribution would be allowed because 2% is going toward the core loan closing costs.</p><!-- USDA Loans ------------------------------------------><p>4. <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/3555-1chapter06.pdf" target="_blank">USDA Loan</a> - Seller may contribute up to 6% of the sales price toward the buyer’s reasonable closing costs. Guidelines also state that closing costs can’t exceed those charged by other applicants by the lender for similar transactions such as FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgage loans.</p></div></div></div></section><!-- Services ------------------------------------------------------------><section id="services"><div class="banner dark-cerulean font-large" id="service-ss"><h2 class="slide showing">Mortgage Pre-Approval</h2><h2 class="slide">Down Payment Assistance</h2><h2 class="slide">Mortgage Calculator</h2><h2 class="slide">Home Valuation</h2><h2 class="slide">Comparative Market Analysis</h2><h2 class="slide">Reverse Mortgage</h2><h2 class="slide">Refinance</h2><h2 class="slide">Short Sale Foreclosure</h2></div><div class="main flex-center"><!-- Home Valuation --><div class="col-4 col-s-6"><a href="https://www.jimngo.net/home-valuation" target="_blank"><div class="card-header banner" id="home-valuation-ss"><p class="slide showing">Home Estimate <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></p><p class="slide">Market Comparable <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></p></div><div class="card-body"><ul><li>Do you want to know what your home is worth?</li><li>Are you curious about nearby homes that are for sale or recently sold?</li><li>How about how much your home might be worth in the next two years?</li></ul></div></a></div><!-- Mortgage Calculator --><div class="col-4 col-s-6"><a href="https://www.jimngo.net/mortgage-prequalification-calculator" target="_blank"><div class="card-header banner"><p class="slide showing">Mortgage Calculator <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></p></div></a><div class="card-body"><p style="display:none">Mortgage Prequalification Calculator with Down Payment, PMI, and Taxes.

These loans are written by a wide range of banks, from your hometown locally owned to the fanciest mortgage broker. “Conforming” loans meet Fannie and Freddie’s high requirements, including maximum sales price.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generally, you’ll get a better deal on mortgage insurance that automatically drops off (meaning you no longer have to pay it) once your home reaches a 78 percent loan to value ratio. Also, you’ll pay less in closing costs and your debt to income ratio can be somewhat flexible as long as look really good on paper.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> These are generally the hardest loans to qualify for. Even though there are now three to five percent down payment options, your credit score will need to be around 700 (better is better) and your other ducks should be lined up nice and straight. Consistent employment, savings that can be designated as “reserve funds” and few to no scabs on your credit report are helpful.</p></div><button class="collapsible">FHA</button><div class="content slow"><p>The FHA started insuring loans after the Great Depression as a way of helping people get back into owned property. It basically created the 30 year fixed interest mortgage and continues to carefully oversee which homes can and cannot be purchased in its name.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good option for first time buyers because of low down payment and credit requirements. FHA will accept “soft” credit lines for people who haven’t established credit yet or have very little, so keep that utility bill paid on time. The program allows up to six percent of your closing costs to be financed into your loan, as “seller paid items,” which can help reduce the actual cash you need to close.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> FHA requires a lot more in closing costs because of the additional upfront mortgage insurance deposit. In addition, if you have less than a 10 percent down payment, under the current programs you’ll be forced to keep paying mortgage insurance for the life of the loan, giving you no options but to refinance or sell down the line if you want rid of it (it’s costly, you want rid of it). Not every banker wants to deal with FHA loans because they can be time consuming to write, so you may have to shop a bit to find a good bank.</p></div><button class="collapsible">VA</button><div class="content slow"><p>As part of the benefits that active military members and veterans receive from the government, VA loans are built on a merit-based system. Career military and those honorably discharged early are generally eligible, but short-term members or Reserves may have to meet additional requirements. Anyone who can get this loan will need to bring a Certificate of Eligibility in order to get the ball rolling with an approved lender.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Favorable interest rates, extremely flexible guidelines and absolutely nothing required as a downpayment (often little to nothing required at closing!) There’s no mortgage insurance, just a one time “funding fee” that varies with your service type, downpayment and times you’ve used your Eligibility.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Really, there aren’t any. You can’t get this if you’re not military, though, so that could be a con if you really wanted this most excellent loan type.</p></div><button class="collapsible">USDA</button><div class="content slow"><p>In rural areas, the US Department of Agriculture will offer mortgage lending as a way of helping to keep the local economy flowing. Homes don’t have to be on an acreage, but they do need to be located in communities with under 35,000 inhabitants.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Like VA, USDA are fairly easy to qualify for as the buyer. They can also be zero down loans, though the more you can bring to closing the better. Payment assistance and other types of help are sometimes available for very low income borrowers.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The house you’re buying will undergo significant scrutiny in order to be approved for the program. In all loan programs, your house has to qualify, but the hurdles USDA puts in front of the building are much larger than most other programs. This is good for you, because it means you’re getting a great house, but it makes the process take a lot longer and can be scary for sellers. In addition, there’s a cap on income for potential borrowers.</p></div></div><!-- Non-QM Loan -------------------------------------------------><div class="col-4 col-s-6"><h3 class="heading">Non-Qualified Mortgages</h3><button class="collapsible">Bank Statement Premier</button><div class="content fast"><p>For Highly Qualified Self-Employed Borrowers</p><p>Qualify with 12-months of bank statements and get a floor rate as low as 4.99%</p><ul><li>Loans up to $3M | Cash out refi to $2.5M</li><li>Debt to income ratio up to 43% allowed with minimum FICO score of 680</li><li>Minimum reserves of 6 months and no mortgage lates for 24 months is required</li><li>One Borrower must be self-employed and may have multiple streams of income</li></ul></div><button class="collapsible">Bank Statement</button><div class="content fast"><p>For Self-Employed Borrowers</p><p>Qualify with 12-months bank statements</p><ul><li>Loans up to $3M | Cash out refi to $2.5M | DTI up to 55%</li><li>Min FICO score 600 | Min reserves - 3 months</li><li>No more than 1 mortgage late in past 12 months</li><li>One borrower must be self-employed and may have multiple streams of income</li></ul></div><button class="collapsible">Investor</button><div class="content fast"><p>For Professional Real Estate Investors</p><p>Qualify with subject property cash flow</p><ul><li>Loans up to $2.5M | Cash out refi to $2.0M | DCR = 1.0</li><li>Unlimited financed properties allowed</li><li>Borrower does not need to own a primary residence or investment property</li><li>No tax returns, no employment, no income and no pre-payment penalty</li></ul></div><button class="collapsible">Asset Qualification</button><div class="content fast"><p>For Borrowers with High Cash Liquidity</p><p>Qualify based on verified liquid assets</p><ul><li>Loan amounts up to $3M | Cash out refi up to $2.5M</li><li>Usable Assets: 100% Checking & Savings, 90% Stocks, Bonds & Mutual Funds, 80% Retirement Funds.</li><li>No DTI ratio calculated | Min FICO score 600 | No employment or income on 1003</li></ul></div><button class="collapsible">Agency Plus</button><div class="content fast"><p>For Conforming & Jumbo Loans, and Owners of Multiple Properties Falling Just Outside Qualified Mortgage Parameters</p><p>Qualify with full documentation</p><ul><li>Loan amounts up to $3M | Cash out refi up to $2.5M | DTI up to 55%</li><li>Cash out up to 85% LTV (max. $1.0M)</li><li>Min FICO score 600 | Min reserves - 3 months</li><li>Up to 8 financed properties allowed</li></ul></div></div><!-- Misc --------------------------------------------------------><div class="col-4 col-s-12"><button class="collapsible">Looking To Purchase A Home?</button><div class="content medium"><p>1.

Your interest rate will be lower.</p><p>Putting down a 20% down payment vs. a 3-5% down payment shows your lender/bank that you are more financially stable, thus a good credit risk. The more confident your bank is in your credit score and your ability to pay your loan, the lower the rate they will be willing to give you.</p><p>2. You’ll end up paying less for your home.</p><p>The bigger your down payment, the lower your loan amount will be for your mortgage. If you are able to pay 20% of the cost of your new home at the start of the transaction, you will only pay interest on the remaining 80%. If you put down a 5% down payment, the extra 15% on your loan will accrue interest and end up costing you more in the long run!</p><p>3. Your offer will stand out in a competitive market!</p><p>In a market where many buyers are competing for the same home, sellers like to see offers come in with 20% or larger down payments. The seller gains the same confidence that the bank did above. You are seen as a stronger buyer whose financing is more likely to be approved. Therefore, the deal will be more likely to go through!</p><p>4. You won’t have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</p><p>Simply put, PMI is “an insurance policy that protects the lender if you are unable to pay your mortgage. It’s a monthly fee, rolled into your mortgage payment, that is required for all conforming, conventional loans that have down payments less than 20%.”</p></div><button class="collapsible">How Much House Can You Afford?</button><div class="content medium"><p>Before you start shopping for a new home, determine how much you can afford to spend.</p><p>Here are a few things to consider:</p><ul><li>Your monthly income</li><li>Your available funds for down payment</li><li>Your monthly expenses</li><li>Your credit score</li></ul><p>It's important to consider getting pre-approved from a licensed mortgage professional.
