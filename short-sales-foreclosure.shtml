	<section class="main flex-center" id="ss-collapsible">
		<div class="col-4 col-s-4">
			<button class="collapsible">A short sale is an option if:</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<ul>
					<li>You are ineligible to refinance or modify your mortgage</li>
					<li>You are facing a long-term hardship</li>
					<li>You are behind on your mortgage payments</li>
					<li>You owe more on your home than it's worth</li>
					<li>You have not been able to sell your home at a price that covers what you still owe on your

					<li>You can no longer afford your home and are ready or need to leave</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">What is a short sale?</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>A short sale is one alternative to foreclosure. In a short sale, the home owner, real estate
					professional, and lender work together to form an agreement to sell a home at current market
					value; this agreed upon value is typically below the existing balance on the home owner’s
					mortgage. The property is able to transfer hands to a new owner, removing the overhead and risk
					from the lender’s portfolio and relieving the existing home owner of the burden of an underwater
					mortgage. The short sale process can prove challenging, stressful, and time consuming; it
					requires persistence and dedication.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Why use an SFR®?</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>Members of the National Association of REALTORS® who have earned the Short Sales and Foreclosure
					Resource certification understand distressed property transactions, and everything that is
					included.</p>
				<p>Working with an SFR® takes the stress out of distressed property transactions. We know that
					selling or buying a home in uncertain times can be scary, but we know how to make it happen.
					With unexpected opportunities everywhere, now is the time to sell or buy.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-4 col-s-4">
			<button class="collapsible">Price</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>The price you offer to the seller of a short-sale property should reflect what’s termed fair
					market value. Fair market value is the price a buyer will pay and a seller will accept for a
					property under reasonable and ordinary conditions. We will provide with a comparative market
					analysis (CMA) that includes listings of comparable properties that have sold in the last 6
					months as well as pending listings so that you can make an informed decision on how much to
					offer. However, please note that the listing price of the short-sale property may or may not
					reflect market value.</p>
				<p>Some short-sale properties are priced extremely aggressively with the goal of creating a bidding
					war, which may still backfire if the offer accepted by the seller is not approved by the lender.
				</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Length of Time for Approval</button>
			<div class="content fast">
				<p>Each lender has its own protocol for approving short sales. We will need to allow a sufficient
					amount of time in the contract to assure both the seller and the seller’s lender that they are
					not wasting their time with your offer.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Earnest Money</button>
			<div class="content fast">
				<p>This deposit at time of contract indicates to the seller that you are acting in good faith and
					will attempt to satisfy all contingencies within your control within the time frames agreed to
					in the contract. It also shows the lender that your contract has a reasonable chance of closing.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-4 col-s-4">
			<button class="collapsible">Home Inspection</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>Most short sales are sold “as is.” All buyers should complete a home inspection. The purpose of
					the home inspection is to determine, based upon condition, if the property is acceptable on the
					terms offered to the seller. You will want to complete a home inspection within a few days
					following the signing of the contract. You should not wait to complete the home inspection until
					after the contract is approved because you may possibly waste months in a contract that ends up
					failing because of property condition.</p>
				<p>If the inspection report alerts you to defects prior to the seller’s lender receiving the
					contract, you may be able to renegotiate terms with the seller based upon the defects.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Mortgage Application</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>Frequently, seller’s lenders give limited time to close after approval and if you have not
					started your mortgage process, you will not be able to meet the required date for closing.
					Often, buyer’s lenders are reluctant to order the appraisal prior to approval by the seller’s
					lender. Although an appraisal will need to be updated if more than six months had passed, many
					buyers have found that ordering it and possibly paying for an update have saved them money since
					the appraisal done by their mortgage lender was a major influence on the seller’s lender when
					the seller’s lender expected to negotiate a higher sales price than what was offered. This is
					your decision and you need to instruct your lender on how you want to proceed.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Attorney Modification</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>If there is an attorney modification clause in the contract being used you will want your
					attorney to look over the contract and make modifications within the time frame allotted
					starting from the signing of the contract by you and the seller—not from the time the lender
					approves it. Whatever time frame is agreed to must be provided for both sides, and allowing a
					seller to get out of the contract after it is approved by the lender puts you in jeopardy. As a
					reminder, it is important that you choose an attorney who understands the short-sale process.

				<h3 class="heading">Qualified Mortgages</h3>
				<button class="collapsible">Conventional</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>If you’ve heard of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you know the family of conventional loans. These
						loans are written by a wide range of banks, from your hometown locally owned to the fanciest
						mortgage broker. “Conforming” loans meet Fannie and Freddie’s high requirements, including
						maximum sales price.</p>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generally, you’ll get a better deal on mortgage insurance that
						automatically drops off (meaning you no longer have to pay it) once your home reaches a 78
						percent loan to value ratio. Also, you’ll pay less in closing costs and your debt to income
						ratio can be somewhat flexible as long as look really good on paper.</p>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong> These are generally the hardest loans to qualify for. Even though there
						are now three to five percent down payment options, your credit score will need to be around 700
						(better is better) and your other ducks should be lined up nice and straight. Consistent
						employment, savings that can be designated as “reserve funds” and few to no scabs on your credit
						report are helpful.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsible">FHA</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>The FHA started insuring loans after the Great Depression as a way of helping people get back
						into owned property. It basically created the 30 year fixed interest mortgage and continues to
						carefully oversee which homes can and cannot be purchased in its name.</p>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good option for first time buyers because of low down payment and credit
						requirements. FHA will accept “soft” credit lines for people who haven’t established credit yet
						or have very little, so keep that utility bill paid on time. The program allows up to six
						percent of your closing costs to be financed into your loan, as “seller paid items,” which can
						help reduce the actual cash you need to close.</p>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong> FHA requires a lot more in closing costs because of the additional upfront
						mortgage insurance deposit. In addition, if you have less than a 10 percent down payment, under
						the current programs you’ll be forced to keep paying mortgage insurance for the life of the
						loan, giving you no options but to refinance or sell down the line if you want rid of it (it’s
						costly, you want rid of it). Not every banker wants to deal with FHA loans because they can be
						time consuming to write, so you may have to shop a bit to find a good bank.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsible">VA</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>As part of the benefits that active military members and veterans receive from the government, VA
						loans are built on a merit-based system. Career military and those honorably discharged early
						are generally eligible, but short-term members or Reserves may have to meet additional
						requirements. Anyone who can get this loan will need to bring a Certificate of Eligibility in
						order to get the ball rolling with an approved lender.</p>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Favorable interest rates, extremely flexible guidelines and absolutely
						nothing required as a downpayment (often little to nothing required at closing!) There’s no
						mortgage insurance, just a one time “funding fee” that varies with your service type,
						downpayment and times you’ve used your Eligibility.</p>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Really, there aren’t any. You can’t get this if you’re not military,
						though, so that could be a con if you really wanted this most excellent loan type.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsible">USDA</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>In rural areas, the US Department of Agriculture will offer mortgage lending as a way of helping
						to keep the local economy flowing. Homes don’t have to be on an acreage, but they do need to be
						located in communities with under 35,000 inhabitants.</p>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Like VA, USDA are fairly easy to qualify for as the buyer. They can also
						be zero down loans, though the more you can bring to closing the better. Payment assistance and
						other types of help are sometimes available for very low income borrowers.</p>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The house you’re buying will undergo significant scrutiny in order to be
						approved for the program. In all loan programs, your house has to qualify, but the hurdles USDA
						puts in front of the building are much larger than most other programs. This is good for you,
						because it means you’re getting a great house, but it makes the process take a lot longer and
						can be scary for sellers. In addition, there’s a cap on income for potential borrowers.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">The Benefits Of A 20% Down Payment</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>1. Your interest rate will be lower.</p>
					<p>Putting down a 20% down payment vs. a 3-5% down payment shows your lender/bank that you are more
						financially stable, thus a good credit risk. The more confident your bank is in your credit
						score and your ability to pay your loan, the lower the rate they will be willing to give you.
					</p>
					<p>2. You’ll end up paying less for your home.</p>
					<p>The bigger your down payment, the lower your loan amount will be for your mortgage. If you are
						able to pay 20% of the cost of your new home at the start of the transaction, you will only pay
						interest on the remaining 80%. If you put down a 5% down payment, the extra 15% on your loan
						will accrue interest and end up costing you more in the long run!</p>
					<p>3. Your offer will stand out in a competitive market!</p>
					<p>In a market where many buyers are competing for the same home, sellers like to see offers come in
						with 20% or larger down payments. The seller gains the same confidence that the bank did above.
						You are seen as a stronger buyer whose financing is more likely to be approved. Therefore, the
						deal will be more likely to go through!</p>
					<p>4. You won’t have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</p>
					<p>Simply put, PMI is “an insurance policy that protects the lender if you are unable to pay your
						mortgage. It’s a monthly fee, rolled into your mortgage payment, that is required for all
						conforming, conventional loans that have down payments less than 20%.”</p>

				<button class="collapsible">How Much House Can You Afford?</button>
				<div class="content medium">
					<p>Before you start shopping for a new home, determine how much you can afford to spend.</p>
					<p>Here are a few things to consider:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your monthly income</li>
						<li>Your available funds for down payment</li>
						<li>Your monthly expenses</li>
						<li>Your credit score</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It's important to consider getting pre-approved from a licensed mortgage professional. An
						Independent Mortgage Professional will be able to offer you several loan options and find the
						best available loan program for your needs.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">6 Things Not To Do When Applying For A Mortgage</button>
				<div class="content medium">
					<p>When lenders review your application, they like to see consistency in your finances.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Do not make major purchases like furniture, appliances, jewelry, vehicles or vacations</li>
						<li>Don't change or quit your job</li>
						<li>Consult with your mortgage professional before withdrawing, depositing, or moving large
							amounts of money in or out of your bank account</li>
						<li>Do not pay off debts or collections (unless instructed to do so by a mortgage professional)
						</li>
						<li>Avoid using cash for a good-faith deposit - cash is difficult to verify and could result in
							a closing delay.</li>
						<li>Don't have your credit report pulled too many times - this can hurt your credit score</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsible">Acceptable Sources of Cash to Close Funds</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>Providing proper asset documentation and the actual source of the funds is a critical element of
						the loan closing process.</p>
					<p>There’s nothing worse in a real estate purchase than making it all the way through the hoops and
						hurdles just to have a loan denied after the final documents have been signed due to the
						borrower using the wrong checking account for the down payment.</p>
					<p>Seasoning of the down payment money is just as important as the source, which is why underwriters
						typically require at least two months bank / asset statements in the initial mortgage approval
						process.</p>
					<p>A Few Acceptable Sources Of Down Payment Include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Bank Accounts – checking / savings</li>
						<li>Investment Accounts – money market, mutual funds</li>
						<li>Retirement Funds – keep in mind that borrowing against a 401K plan will require a repayment,
							which will be calculated in the Debt-to-Income Ratio</li>
						<li>Life Insurance – Cash value and face amount</li>
						<li>Gifts – Family members can gift down payment funds with certain restrictions</li>
						<li>Inheritance / Trust Funds</li>
						<li>Government Grants – Many state, county and city agencies offer special down payment
							assistance programs.</li>
