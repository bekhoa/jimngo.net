          <ul>
            <li>The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) - which is part of HUD - insures the loan, so your
              lender can offer you a better deal.</li>
            <li>Down payment as low as 3.5%. <span style="color: darkgreen">Gift</span> funds accepted,
              family members are welcome to help out with your down payment.</li>
            <li>Mortgage Insurance includes an Upfront Funding Fee of 1.75% of the loan amount, typically
              financed into the loan, and an annual insurance premium of 0.85%, which will be lumped into
              the monthly payment. For down payment of 5% or more, the annual insurance premium will be
              0.80%.</li>
            <li>FHA has loan limit which varies by county. Please visit <a
