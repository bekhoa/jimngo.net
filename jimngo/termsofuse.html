                Protecting Children
            </h3>
            <p>

                The safety of children is very important to us. The Site is a general audience Website
                that complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. When a child under
                age 13 attempts to register with the Site, we ask that they have a parent or guardian
                establish an account. This is to ensure that the parent or guardian consents to
                the collection and use of personally identifying information from that child. If
                a parent wishes to refuse to permit further collection or use of their child's information
                by BDX, that parent can send an e-mail to us at <a href="mailto:support@newhomesourceprofessional.com">
                    support@newhomesourceprofessional.com
                </a> to request deletion of their child's account.
            </p>
            <p>
                BDX strives to create a truly safe place for children on the Internet and over the
                airwaves. Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering
                services) are commercially available that may assist parents in limiting access
                to content that may be harmful to minors.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Housing for Older Persons
            </h3>
            <a id="housing"></a>
            <p>
                The Fair Housing Act prohibits certain forms of discrimination including discrimination
                against households with children under the age of 18. This prohibition does not
                apply to "housing for older persons". Generally, "housing for older persons" falls
                into two categories: housing intended for, and solely occupied by persons 62 years
                of age or older; and housing that meets certain requirements including that at least
                80% of the units are occupied by at least one person who is at least 55 years old.
                Some sellers who provide listings to NewRetirementCommunities.com represent to us
                that they fall under one of these exceptions, and consequently may restrict occupancy
                based on certain age restrictions. In an effort to assist buyers, NewRetirementCommunities.com
                identifies those communities that are age restricted. To find the community that
                best suits your needs, look for the "age restricted" and "all ages" indicators on
                each listing or community detail page
            </p>

                area Services, if offered, so that everyone feels free to share opinions and ideas.

                following basic rules of conduct when using the Services:

                <li>
                    You will never give your password to anyone (no BDX employee will ever ask for
