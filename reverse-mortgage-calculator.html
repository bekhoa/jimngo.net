                    <h1 style="font-size: 200%; color: dodgerblue">Reverse Mortgage - Home Equity Conversion Mortgage
                        (HECM)</h1>
                    <p>A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan that can turn part of the equity you’ve built up in
                        your house into funds you can use today, or a line of credit that will be there when you need
                        it. Specifically designed for homeowners age 62+, it offers all the benefits of a traditional
                        line of credit that you can get from a bank but with additional benefits - including a flexible
                        repayment feature. As with any mortgage, the title to the home remains in your name, not the
                        lender’s.</p>
                    <p>At a minimum, to be eligible you must be 62 years of age or older; you must have a certain
                        percentage of equity in the home; and the house must be your principal residence.</p>
                    <h2 style="font-size: 150%; color: dodgerblue">Reverse Mortgage Advantages</h2>
                    <p>A reverse mortgage has certain advantages over other types of home equity-based loans. Since a
                        HECM reverse mortgage is FHA-insured, if the loan balance ever exceeds the value of your home
                        you and your heirs are not responsible to pay the excess. As long as you satisfy your loan
                        obligations, which include maintaining your home, paying your real estate taxes, property
                        insurance and any homeowners association (HOA) fees.</p>

                            <p>You can purchase a home by combining a one-time investment of your own funds (down
                                payment) with loan proceeds from a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) to complete
                                the transaction. As with a traditional “forward” mortgage, the home you are purchasing
                                secures the loan.</p>
                            <p>However, unlike a traditional mortgage, there are no monthly mortgage payments, which
                                can help
                                boost your cash flow. You own the home as long as you live in it. The loan does not
                                have to be repaid
                                until you sell the home or no longer live there as your primary residence. In order
                                for the loan to
                                remain in good standing, you must meet certain home ownership obligations - which
                                include maintaining
                                the property, and keeping current with property-related taxes and insurance

                                originated reverse mortgage loans having a fixed rate:</p>

                                <li>Fixed rate will remain the same for the entire loan term, so you are protected

                                    rise.</li>
                                <li>Borrowers who choose a fixed rate reverse mortgage must take their funds as a
                                    lump sum, as
                                    opposed to other disbursement options offered at a variable rate.</li>
                                <li>When taking a lump sum, borrowers are restricted to pull only up to 60% of the
                                    principal limit of
                                    the loan.</li>

                            <p>Due to these details, fixed rate reverse mortgages are usually best for borrowers who
                                plan to use
                                their reverse mortgage funds all at once, such as to pay off an existing mortgage or
                                other debt, or to
                                make major home repairs or modifications.</p>

                            <p>The less popular, but oftentimes the more flexible option, is the variable rate. Just
                                as the fixed
                                rate is “fixed” for the loan period, a variable rate varies throughout the loan
                                period. There are pros
                                and cons to variable rate reverse mortgages:</p>

                                <li>They come with more disbursement options then a fixed rate loan. Borrowers may
                                    choose between a
                                    line of credit, monthly payments, a lump sum, or a combination of the three.
                                </li>
                                <li>Interest is only charged on funds that have been withdrawn. This means that, if
                                    you have a line
                                    of credit that you rarely use, you will only be charged interest on the amount
                                    withdrawn.</li>
                                <li>Unused lines of credit may also grow with time, allowing the borrower even more
                                    flexibility in
                                    the amount available for them to borrow.</li>
                                <li>Greater risk of your interest rate rising quickly and drastically.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In general, variable rates are best for borrowers who plan to use their reverse
                                mortgage funds over
                                time, or in rare instances. In this way, borrowers may use it to add to their
                                existing fixed income
                                every month, to supplement their other retirement accounts, or as a stand by account
                                so money is
                                readily available in the case of an emergency.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan that’s exclusively for homeowners and homebuyers
                            age 62 and older. It allows borrowers to convert some of the equity in their home into
                            income-tax-free funds. (Not tax advice, consult a tax professional).</p>
                        <p>There are different loan products to choose from that offer you options on what interest rate
                            you are charged, how much money you can access, and how you receive your payments. Unlike a
                            regular “forward” mortgage or traditional home equity loan or home equity line of credit,
                            there are no monthly principal and interest payments as long as at least one of the
                            borrowers lives in the home as their primary residence.</p>
                        <p>As with any mortgage, in order for the loan to remain in good standing the borrower must also
                            keep up with property-related taxes, insurance and upkeep.</p>

                        <p>A HECM is a reverse mortgage loan that's insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

                        <p>To be eligible for a reverse mortgage, you’ll need to meet the requirements set by the
                            federal government:
                            <ul>
                                <li>All borrowers must be age 62 or older (this applies to all co-owners listed on the
                                    home’s title).</li>
                                <li>The home must be your principal residence. And it must meet standards set by the
                                    United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on property type and
                                    condition. You may be able to use your reverse mortgage to pay for any required
                                    repairs in order to meet these standards.</li>
                                <li>Eligible property types include single-family homes, 2- to 4-unit properties,
                                    manufactured homes meeting certain criteria, condominiums that are approved by the
                                    Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and townhouses. Co-ops do not qualify.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>You may still be eligible. Proceeds from your reverse mortgage would first be used to pay off
                            any existing mortgage(s). This means the balance of your existing mortgage(s) will be added
                            to the balance of your reverse mortgage. A licensed RMF loan officer can help you find out
                            if you are eligible.</p>

                        <p>A reverse mortgage offers certain advantages:
                            <ul>
                                <li>With a traditional home equity loan or home equity line of credit, you must make
                                    monthly principal and interest payments on the balance while you live in the home -
                                    with a reverse mortgage, you don't. Your reverse mortgage balance, including accrued
                                    interest and fees, does not have to be repaid until you sell the home or permanently
                                    leave the home, as long as you meet your loan obligations (which includes keeping
                                    current with property-related taxes, insurance and upkeep).</li>
                                <li>With a reverse mortgage line of credit, the unused amount in your credit line
                                    actually grows over time - giving you access to more available funds. This means
                                    that the less you take out up front, the more will be available to you later.</li>
                                <li>And the lender cannot “freeze” or reduce the line of credit, as long as you fulfill
                                    your loan obligations - so it will be there if and when you need it.</li>

                        <p>The funds from a reverse mortgage generally do not affect regular Social Security or Medicare

                            (SSI), may be impacted. One of our licensed reverse mortgage specialists can provide
                            additional general information, but you should contact a financial professional or

                        <p>Yes, with the HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage) For Purchase loan, qualified borrowers
                            can use their loan proceeds to buy a home that better suits their needs and lifestyle. It’s
                            a home financing option that can make it easier for buyers age 62 and older to afford the
                            home they want, while preserving more of their savings.</p>

                            fixed-rate loan will receive their funds as a single disbursement lump sum. A lump sum
                            disbursement is also available with an adjustable rate. A line of credit and monthly

                        <p>With the exception of a fee for government-required reverse mortgage counseling, most of the
                            fees associated with a reverse mortgage can be financed with your loan, so there’s no
                            immediate out-of-pocket cost. The costs are added to the loan amount (“principal”) and paid
                            along with the accrued interest when the loan becomes due. Depending on the loan option you
                            choose, these fees may include an origination fee, closing costs, a mortgage insurance
                            premium (required for HECM loans) and a monthly servicing fee. Ask us about our “Low-Cost
                            HECM” pricing option, which eliminates nearly all origination and closing costs.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>If you’ve heard of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you know the family of conventional loans. These
                        loans are written by a wide range of banks, from your hometown locally owned to the fanciest
                        mortgage broker. “Conforming” loans meet Fannie and Freddie’s high requirements, including
                        maximum sales price.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generally, you’ll get a better deal on mortgage insurance that
                        automatically drops off (meaning you no longer have to pay it) once your home reaches a 78
                        percent loan to value ratio. Also, you’ll pay less in closing costs and your debt to income
                        ratio can be somewhat flexible as long as look really good on paper.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> These are generally the hardest loans to qualify for. Even though there
                        are now three to five percent down payment options, your credit score will need to be around 700
                        (better is better) and your other ducks should be lined up nice and straight. Consistent
                        employment, savings that can be designated as “reserve funds” and few to no scabs on your credit
                        report are helpful.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="collapsible">FHA</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The FHA started insuring loans after the Great Depression as a way of helping people get back
                        into owned property. It basically created the 30 year fixed interest mortgage and continues to
                        carefully oversee which homes can and cannot be purchased in its name.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good option for first time buyers because of low down payment and credit
                        requirements. FHA will accept “soft” credit lines for people who haven’t established credit yet
                        or have very little, so keep that utility bill paid on time. The program allows up to six
                        percent of your closing costs to be financed into your loan, as “seller paid items,” which can
                        help reduce the actual cash you need to close.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> FHA requires a lot more in closing costs because of the additional upfront
                        mortgage insurance deposit. In addition, if you have less than a 10 percent down payment, under
                        the current programs you’ll be forced to keep paying mortgage insurance for the life of the
                        loan, giving you no options but to refinance or sell down the line if you want rid of it (it’s
                        costly, you want rid of it). Not every banker wants to deal with FHA loans because they can be
                        time consuming to write, so you may have to shop a bit to find a good bank.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="collapsible">VA</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>As part of the benefits that active military members and veterans receive from the government, VA
                        loans are built on a merit-based system. Career military and those honorably discharged early
                        are generally eligible, but short-term members or Reserves may have to meet additional
                        requirements. Anyone who can get this loan will need to bring a Certificate of Eligibility in
                        order to get the ball rolling with an approved lender.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Favorable interest rates, extremely flexible guidelines and absolutely
                        nothing required as a downpayment (often little to nothing required at closing!) There’s no
                        mortgage insurance, just a one time “funding fee” that varies with your service type,
                        downpayment and times you’ve used your Eligibility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Really, there aren’t any. You can’t get this if you’re not military,
                        though, so that could be a con if you really wanted this most excellent loan type.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="collapsible">USDA</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>In rural areas, the US Department of Agriculture will offer mortgage lending as a way of helping
                        to keep the local economy flowing. Homes don’t have to be on an acreage, but they do need to be
                        located in communities with under 35,000 inhabitants.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Like VA, USDA are fairly easy to qualify for as the buyer. They can also
                        be zero down loans, though the more you can bring to closing the better. Payment assistance and
                        other types of help are sometimes available for very low income borrowers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> The house you’re buying will undergo significant scrutiny in order to be
                        approved for the program. In all loan programs, your house has to qualify, but the hurdles USDA
                        puts in front of the building are much larger than most other programs. This is good for you,
                        because it means you’re getting a great house, but it makes the process take a lot longer and
                        can be scary for sellers. In addition, there’s a cap on income for potential borrowers.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">The Benefits Of A 20% Down Payment</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>1. Your interest rate will be lower.</p>
                    <p>Putting down a 20% down payment vs. a 3-5% down payment shows your lender/bank that you are more
                        financially stable, thus a good credit risk. The more confident your bank is in your credit
                        score and your ability to pay your loan, the lower the rate they will be willing to give you.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. You’ll end up paying less for your home.</p>
                    <p>The bigger your down payment, the lower your loan amount will be for your mortgage. If you are
                        able to pay 20% of the cost of your new home at the start of the transaction, you will only pay
                        interest on the remaining 80%. If you put down a 5% down payment, the extra 15% on your loan
                        will accrue interest and end up costing you more in the long run!</p>
                    <p>3. Your offer will stand out in a competitive market!</p>
                    <p>In a market where many buyers are competing for the same home, sellers like to see offers come in
                        with 20% or larger down payments. The seller gains the same confidence that the bank did above.
                        You are seen as a stronger buyer whose financing is more likely to be approved. Therefore, the
                        deal will be more likely to go through!</p>
                    <p>4. You won’t have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</p>
                    <p>Simply put, PMI is “an insurance policy that protects the lender if you are unable to pay your
                        mortgage. It’s a monthly fee, rolled into your mortgage payment, that is required for all
                        conforming, conventional loans that have down payments less than 20%.”</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Before you start shopping for a new home, determine how much you can afford to spend.</p>
                    <p>Here are a few things to consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your monthly income</li>
                        <li>Your available funds for down payment</li>
                        <li>Your monthly expenses</li>
                        <li>Your credit score</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's important to consider getting pre-approved from a licensed mortgage professional. An
                        Independent Mortgage Professional will be able to offer you several loan options and find the
                        best available loan program for your needs.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>When lenders review your application, they like to see consistency in your finances.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do not make major purchases like furniture, appliances, jewelry, vehicles or vacations</li>
                        <li>Don't change or quit your job</li>
                        <li>Consult with your mortgage professional before withdrawing, depositing, or moving large
                            amounts of money in or out of your bank account</li>
                        <li>Do not pay off debts or collections (unless instructed to do so by a mortgage professional)
                        </li>
                        <li>Avoid using cash for a good-faith deposit - cash is difficult to verify and could result in
                            a closing delay.</li>
                        <li>Don't have your credit report pulled too many times - this can hurt your credit score</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <button class="collapsible">Acceptable Sources of Cash to Close Funds</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Providing proper asset documentation and the actual source of the funds is a critical element of
                        the loan closing process.</p>
                    <p>There’s nothing worse in a real estate purchase than making it all the way through the hoops and
                        hurdles just to have a loan denied after the final documents have been signed due to the
                        borrower using the wrong checking account for the down payment.</p>
                    <p>Seasoning of the down payment money is just as important as the source, which is why underwriters
                        typically require at least two months bank / asset statements in the initial mortgage approval
                        process.</p>
                    <p>A Few Acceptable Sources Of Down Payment Include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bank Accounts – checking / savings</li>
                        <li>Investment Accounts – money market, mutual funds</li>
                        <li>Retirement Funds – keep in mind that borrowing against a 401K plan will require a repayment,
                            which will be calculated in the Debt-to-Income Ratio</li>
                        <li>Life Insurance – Cash value and face amount</li>
                        <li>Gifts – Family members can gift down payment funds with certain restrictions</li>
                        <li>Inheritance / Trust Funds</li>
                        <li>Government Grants – Many state, county and city agencies offer special down payment
                            assistance programs.</li>
                    </ul>
