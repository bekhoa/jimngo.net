                <h1 style="font-size: 150%; color: dodgerblue">Mortgage Insurance</h1>
                <p>Whether you’re in the process of buying your first home or you’ve been a homeowner for years, there
                    are few phrases that hit right to the bone like “mortgage insurance.” Why, you’re not sure entirely,
                    but lots of people indicated that it was terrible and you were going to regret it.</p>
                <p>As usual, the truth lies somewhere closer to the middle. Mortgage insurance is not your enemy, but it
                    can be a costly surprise if you’re not prepared. Let’s dive into this hot button topic.</p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 150%; color: dodgerblue">What Exactly is Mortgage Insurance?</h2>
                <p>Mortgage insurance is a type of coverage that your lender will take out on your loan to help shield
                    them against loss should you default. They generally only require it if you have less than 20
                    percent down and often, this monthly payment will drop off once you’ve paid your home loan down to
                    the point that your house has about 22 percent in equity versus its mortgage.</p>
                <p>To be clear, <strong>this insurance does not cover you</strong> — at least not directly. In the case
                    of default, the bank gets the check, but you get something, too. In many states, even <a
                        href="https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/what-is-a-recourse-state.html"
                        target="_blank" rel="nofollow">recourse states</a>, the mortgage insurance can be enough to
                    prevent the bank from coming back on you for the difference between what you owe and what it was
                    able to recover at a public sale.</p>
                <p>Having mortgage insurance does not guarantee you will be free and clear should you lose your home,
                    but it sure helps, especially if that house is in good condition when you turn it over to the bank.
                    Its original purpose was to make it easier for people to get mortgages, even if they couldn’t come
                    up with a big down payment, but during the housing bubble a decade ago many homeowners discovered
                    that it can help on the back end, too.

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Mortgage insurance is a blanket term for several different insurance programs that essentially do the
                    same thing. Rather than just calling it “mortgage insurance” across the industry, due to the way
                    each program came into being in sort of a vacuum, different loan types have different names for it.
                    For example:</p>
                <p>FHA calls it MIP, the Mortgage Insurance Premium. It was one of the first programs and the name
                    is an original, for sure. It requires both an upfront and monthly payment</p>
                <p>Private Mortgage Insurance is available on conventional loans and will be provided by one of a
                    few different companies, <a href="https://www.mgic.com/ratefinder-rates/quickQuoteDataEntry.htm"
                        target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MGIC</a> being one of the biggest.</p>
                <p>Many people think that VA loans don’t have mortgage insurance, but they do — it’s a one time
                    charge at closing known as the “Funding Fee.”</p>
                <p>For most people, having mortgage insurance is just a reality of life. They can either continue to
                    give their entire payment to someone else to pay off real estate the renter will never have a stake
                    in, or they can give a fraction of their payment over to the bank in order to be given a chance to
                    establish some equity and build a little wealth, even if it’s in the form of the family home.</p>
                <p>Since the pricing of your mortgage insurance is based largely on your outstanding mortgage balance,
                    the payment will get smaller and smaller each year. You can expect to pay from a half percent to one
                    percent of your total mortgage balance annually. So, for example, if you borrow $300,000 to buy your
                    home, your mortgage insurance payment will be anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000, or $125 to $250 a
                    month, the first year.</p>

            <div class="card-header">Getting Rid of Mortgage Insurance</div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Although mortgage insurance has its place, you don’t want to pay it forever. If you borrowed using an
                    FHA program after the summer of 2013 and had less than 10 percent down, you probably have lifetime
                    mortgage insurance.</p>
                <p>Usually, once you reach 78 percent loan to value, based either on the original appraisal or an
                    updated one, the bank will drop your mortgage insurance. You may have to write a formal request, but
                    it’s not that big of a deal. With these FHA products, the mortgage insurance is meant to stay for
                    the entire life of the loan. So, your options to shed it are a little trickier. You can:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Avoid it entirely by using a piggyback loan</strong>. This is a combination mortgage
                        made up of an 80 percent LTV conventional loan and a 15 percent LTV secondary loan. That
                        secondary loan, however, can have a pretty high base interest rate and may have terms like an
                        adjustable rate, a shorter amortization period or a prepayment penalty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bring more to closing</strong>. Hey, it’s not fun to crack your piggy bank or 401(k) to
                        get extra money, but there are times when it makes sense. This is one of them. You always need
                        somewhere to live, you might as well be building equity, too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refinance the monster</strong>. If you’ve noticed prices in your neighborhood rising
                        dramatically or you’ve just been paying on your mortgage a while, it could pay to refinance your
                        loan. Your Realtor can help you determine if it will be worthwhile to spend the money for a new
                        appraisal and new loan paperwork. That’s also the downside, though. It can cost as much to
                        refinance at the wrong time as you’re paying in mortgage insurance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sell your home</strong>. You know, it was a good home, but you’re sick to death of
                        paying the mortgage insurance. You plan to take the sale proceeds to buy another place that you
                        can put at least 10 percent down on to avoid further incidents of lifetime mortgage insurance.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Most of the time, if you compare your mortgage insurance to the alternatives, it’s not really that
                    big of a deal to pay an extra percent for the ability to buy a home with five percent down, rather
                    than when you finally have 20 percent down</p>
