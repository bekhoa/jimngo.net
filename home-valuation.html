					<h1 style="font-size: 150%; color: dodgerblue">What Is My Home Worth?</h1>
					<p>Home values are determined through a complicated series of calculations roughly based on the cost
						of actual construction plus value-adds like proximity to shopping and other conveniences. The
						prices that other nearby homes have sold for in the past are also taken into consideration.
						Formulas are applied, mysterious algorithms are run. In short, home valuation is magic and
						appraisers are all wizards. </p>
					<p>Real estate is also very personal and emotional. Two houses with the same floor plan, but
						different shades of brick or different trees in the front yard can have different values to the
						person doing the buying.</p>
					<p>With today's technology, homeowners and buyers across the country can easily go online and search
						for the value of their homes or a home they're considering buying. Please keep in mind that it
						is only an estimate, a general idea about the value of the home. The only way to know a home’s
						actual value is to reach out to a professional home appraiser for his or her formal opinion, and
						then ultimately, a home is only worth what the market will bear and what a buyer will give. So
						again, how do you find this magic number?</p>
					<p>Below are my suggestions:</p>

					<div class="card-body">
						<p>Real estate agents specialize in answering the question "what is my home worth?" for
							their clients, which they do by running a comparative market analysis. This process
							involves finding similar properties (“comps”) that sold within the past 90 days. The
							most accurate comp is a home that’s nearby, similar to yours in square footage, and
							has the same number of bedrooms and bathrooms. (Ideally, the lot size is also
							equivalent, but that's more important in rural areas, where homes are set on
							multiple acres.) Once your agent finds a few recently sold comps, then she averages
							the purchase prices and uses that figure as a baseline for how much your home is
							worth.</p>

			<button class="collapsible">What Is My Home Worth to A Buyer?</button>
			<div class="content medium">
				<p>Sellers need to consider how home buyers search for properties online. Let’s assume your home's fair
					market value is $503,000.Yet Dossman points out that many people search for homes on the web using
					$20,000 or $25,000 increments. The upshot? Listing your home for $503,000 could prevent your listing
					from being seen by buyers who are searching for homes in the $475,000 to $500,000 bracket, so
					knocking off $3,000 for an asking price of $500,000 might generate more traffic—and maybe even a
					bidding war to push that price above your expectations.</p>
				<p>Also, avoid listing your home at an odd dollar figure (e.g., $999,000 instead of $1 million). While
					retailers and as-seen-on-TV purveyors of the Miracle Mop effectively price products ending in $0.95
					or $0.99, Dossman says the same approach doesn’t apply to real estate: “It’s hard to justify awkward
					pricing. It’s just confusing to buyers.”</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Your Neighborhood</button>
			<div class="content fast">
				<p>“You should always look at what other properties are listed for in your community,” says Chris
					Dossman, a real estate agent with Century 21 Scheetz in Indianapolis. For instance, “if your
					neighbor’s home is listed for $400,000 and you want to list yours at $500,000, you'd better be able
					to clearly explain the price difference to prospective buyers." Or else adjust your price
					accordingly.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Try to Remain Objective</button>
			<div class="content fast">
				<p>“Sellers always think that their home is worth more than it is, because of their personal
					attachment,” says Dossman. Indeed, it’s hard to boil down years or decades of memories in a home to
					a number. It's also hard to accept that your home is worth less than what you paid for it, or that
					you can't just tack on the price of the renovations you've made. On average, renovations will reap
					you only a 64% return on investment, although that varies based on the type of upgrades you've made.
				</p>
			</div>
			<button class="collapsible">Why It's Important to Price Your Home Right</button>
			<div class="content flex-perfect-center slow">
				<div class="col-8 col-s-8">
					<p>Price your home too high, and it could wind up sitting on the market. That’s a big problem,
						because a property that goes unsold for an extended period of time (e.g., more than 30 days)
						often becomes stigmatized.</p>
					<p>“Buyers get suspicious when they see a house that’s been on the market for a while,” says
						Dossman. “They think that something is wrong with the home.” If that’s the case, the seller may
						have to make a significant price reduction—sometimes dropping the price below market value—in
						order to nab a buyer.
					</p>
					<p>Pricing your home below market value in an attempt to stir interest and generate multiple bids
						can also backfire. Granted, the strategy that could work in a hot seller’s market, but
						underpricing your home frequently leads buyers to assume that your home is worth only its list
						price, says Dossman.</p>
					<p>Your best bet: Know what your home is worth and list your home close to that figure—aka its
						market value. When in doubt, turn to your real estate agent to help you cut through the haze and
						help you pinpoint the right price.</p>

			<button class="collapsible" id="tip_4">10 Reasons Why Your Home Isn't Selling</button>
			<div class="content slow">
				<p>The waiting game isn’t a fun a game to play - especially when it comes to selling your home. You’ve
					put your house up on the market. Yet, you haven’t had one single offer. So, what’s going on? There
					are a variety of reasons why your home isn’t selling. Forewarning: You might need to make a few
					adjustments.</p>
				<p>Here are the top 10 reasons why your home isn’t selling (and don’t worry, most of them are fixable!).
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h4>You Lack Marketing</h4>
						<p>“If we build it, they will come.” This doesn’t prove true for many new (and sometimes,
							useful!) products. And same goes for when you put your home up for sale. Just putting it up
							on the market isn’t enough. You need to post your listing in as many places as possible.
							Most of these places are online. Online is the first place potential buyers check out.</p>
						<p>Real estate agents can also be great resources for this. If you haven’t hire one, think about
							it. If you have, make sure they are doing their job. Ask questions regarding where your
							house is listed. And if they aren’t doing a good job, it might prove best to switch agents -
							Find someone that knows what they are doing and has ample experience.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Your House is Priced Too High</h4>
						<p>This is a common mistake. Too high of a price won’t exactly woe any buyers. It can deter
							people from even viewing your home - It’s not in their budget. And it may be obvious that
							the home isn’t worth the price tag. You should do your market research before determining a
							price for your home. Compare your home to others currently on the market. Again, a real
							estate agent can help you out with this!
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Your Home is In Serious Need of Repairs</h4>
						<p>A lot of people don’t want to buy a home that needs work. It isn’t ideal. So, what can you
							do? You could have someone come in and do a pre-listing inspection. From there, fix the
							problems. It will help you sell your house faster.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Your Home Isn’t Prepared For Showings</h4>
						<p>That first impression matters! If you haven’t done it yet, get an expert to set up or make
							suggestions to switch things up so your house shows better. You might have to move furniture
							around. But it is entirely worth it.</p>
						<p>Other ways to make your house show worthy? Make sure it is tidy and clean. If you have pets,
							clean up after them. Pay attention to the temperature. If it’s winter, make sure it feels
							warm and inviting. If it’s summer, make sure you have the A/C on and working.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Your Location is Anything But Ideal</h4>
						<p>This is a tough one to fix. If the location isn’t exactly sought-after, be prepared to play
							the waiting game. It might just take more time to find that perfect buyer.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>It Smells</h4>
						<p>We get used to the smell of our own home. And unfortunately, it can be hard to detect. Some
							of the most common odors that throw buyers off include cigarettes, pets, food, and moisture.
							Do a smell test. Have a friend or neighbour come by to make sure you are good to go.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Bad Timing</h4>
						<p>In real estate, there is a good time to sell and a bad time to sell. If the market isn’t
							looking good to sell, it may be best to wait (and there are tons of reasons that this may be
							the case). Do your research. Ask your local real estate agent. Find the right time for your
							area and location.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>The Local Market is Working Against You</h4>
						<p>It’s not just timing you have to worry about. Are a lot of people selling around you? Is it a
							buyers market in your area? That might be why your home isn’t selling. Again, your real
							estate agent should be able to point you in the right direction for this one. The time of
							year plus the number of houses on sale play a huge role in whether your house sells or not.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>You Hired The Wrong Real Estate Agent</h4>
						<p>This can be a major problem. You want someone with experience, who is reliable, and knows the
							market. Make sure you take your time choosing your real estate agent. It’s okay to meet with
							a few before selecting yours.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>You Aren’t Flexible</h4>
						<p>You stand your ground on your asking price. But everyone is putting in offers that are lower.
							You don’t bother with repairs even though it’s the main reason your home inspection fell
							through. These could potentially be reasons why your home isn’t selling. Get those repairs
							done. Be flexible and realistic when it comes to pricing and offers. Or else yes, it will
							take a lot more time for your house to sell.</p>
						<p>Go through the above reasons and be honest with yourself. Determine why your home isn’t
							selling - then, find ways to fix the problem. Or at least come to terms with it. Don’t make
							selling your home more of a hassle or process than it has to be.</p>

				<h3 class="heading">Qualified Mortgages</h3>
				<button class="collapsible">Conventional</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>If you’ve heard of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you know the family of conventional loans. These
						loans are written by a wide range of banks, from your hometown locally owned to the fanciest
						mortgage broker. “Conforming” loans meet Fannie and Freddie’s high requirements, including
						maximum sales price.</p>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generally, you’ll get a better deal on mortgage insurance that
						automatically drops off (meaning you no longer have to pay it) once your home reaches a 78
						percent loan to value ratio. Also, you’ll pay less in closing costs and your debt to income
						ratio can be somewhat flexible as long as look really good on paper.</p>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong> These are generally the hardest loans to qualify for. Even though there
						are now three to five percent down payment options, your credit score will need to be around 700
						(better is better) and your other ducks should be lined up nice and straight. Consistent
						employment, savings that can be designated as “reserve funds” and few to no scabs on your credit
						report are helpful.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsible">FHA</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>The FHA started insuring loans after the Great Depression as a way of helping people get back
						into owned property. It basically created the 30 year fixed interest mortgage and continues to
						carefully oversee which homes can and cannot be purchased in its name.</p>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good option for first time buyers because of low down payment and credit
						requirements. FHA will accept “soft” credit lines for people who haven’t established credit yet
						or have very little, so keep that utility bill paid on time. The program allows up to six
						percent of your closing costs to be financed into your loan, as “seller paid items,” which can
						help reduce the actual cash you need to close.</p>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong> FHA requires a lot more in closing costs because of the additional upfront
						mortgage insurance deposit. In addition, if you have less than a 10 percent down payment, under
						the current programs you’ll be forced to keep paying mortgage insurance for the life of the
						loan, giving you no options but to refinance or sell down the line if you want rid of it (it’s
						costly, you want rid of it). Not every banker wants to deal with FHA loans because they can be
						time consuming to write, so you may have to shop a bit to find a good bank.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsible">VA</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>As part of the benefits that active military members and veterans receive from the government, VA
						loans are built on a merit-based system. Career military and those honorably discharged early
						are generally eligible, but short-term members or Reserves may have to meet additional
						requirements. Anyone who can get this loan will need to bring a Certificate of Eligibility in
						order to get the ball rolling with an approved lender.</p>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Favorable interest rates, extremely flexible guidelines and absolutely
						nothing required as a downpayment (often little to nothing required at closing!) There’s no
						mortgage insurance, just a one time “funding fee” that varies with your service type,
						downpayment and times you’ve used your Eligibility.</p>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Really, there aren’t any. You can’t get this if you’re not military,
						though, so that could be a con if you really wanted this most excellent loan type.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsible">USDA</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>In rural areas, the US Department of Agriculture will offer mortgage lending as a way of helping
						to keep the local economy flowing. Homes don’t have to be on an acreage, but they do need to be
						located in communities with under 35,000 inhabitants.</p>
					<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Like VA, USDA are fairly easy to qualify for as the buyer. They can also
						be zero down loans, though the more you can bring to closing the better. Payment assistance and
						other types of help are sometimes available for very low income borrowers.</p>
					<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The house you’re buying will undergo significant scrutiny in order to be
						approved for the program. In all loan programs, your house has to qualify, but the hurdles USDA
						puts in front of the building are much larger than most other programs. This is good for you,
						because it means you’re getting a great house, but it makes the process take a lot longer and
						can be scary for sellers. In addition, there’s a cap on income for potential borrowers.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">The Benefits Of A 20% Down Payment</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>1. Your interest rate will be lower.</p>
					<p>Putting down a 20% down payment vs. a 3-5% down payment shows your lender/bank that you are more
						financially stable, thus a good credit risk. The more confident your bank is in your credit
						score and your ability to pay your loan, the lower the rate they will be willing to give you.
					</p>
					<p>2. You’ll end up paying less for your home.</p>
					<p>The bigger your down payment, the lower your loan amount will be for your mortgage. If you are
						able to pay 20% of the cost of your new home at the start of the transaction, you will only pay
						interest on the remaining 80%. If you put down a 5% down payment, the extra 15% on your loan
						will accrue interest and end up costing you more in the long run!</p>
					<p>3. Your offer will stand out in a competitive market!</p>
					<p>In a market where many buyers are competing for the same home, sellers like to see offers come in
						with 20% or larger down payments. The seller gains the same confidence that the bank did above.
						You are seen as a stronger buyer whose financing is more likely to be approved. Therefore, the
						deal will be more likely to go through!</p>
					<p>4. You won’t have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</p>
					<p>Simply put, PMI is “an insurance policy that protects the lender if you are unable to pay your
						mortgage. It’s a monthly fee, rolled into your mortgage payment, that is required for all
						conforming, conventional loans that have down payments less than 20%.”</p>

				<button class="collapsible">How Much House Can You Afford?</button>
				<div class="content medium">
					<p>Before you start shopping for a new home, determine how much you can afford to spend.</p>
					<p>Here are a few things to consider:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your monthly income</li>
						<li>Your available funds for down payment</li>
						<li>Your monthly expenses</li>
						<li>Your credit score</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It's important to consider getting pre-approved from a licensed mortgage professional. An
						Independent Mortgage Professional will be able to offer you several loan options and find the
						best available loan program for your needs.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">6 Things Not To Do When Applying For A Mortgage</button>
				<div class="content medium">
					<p>When lenders review your application, they like to see consistency in your finances.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Do not make major purchases like furniture, appliances, jewelry, vehicles or vacations</li>
						<li>Don't change or quit your job</li>
						<li>Consult with your mortgage professional before withdrawing, depositing, or moving large
							amounts of money in or out of your bank account</li>
						<li>Do not pay off debts or collections (unless instructed to do so by a mortgage professional)
						</li>
						<li>Avoid using cash for a good-faith deposit - cash is difficult to verify and could result in
							a closing delay.</li>
						<li>Don't have your credit report pulled too many times - this can hurt your credit score</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsible">Acceptable Sources of Cash to Close Funds</button>
				<div class="content slow">
					<p>Providing proper asset documentation and the actual source of the funds is a critical element of
						the loan closing process.</p>
					<p>There’s nothing worse in a real estate purchase than making it all the way through the hoops and
						hurdles just to have a loan denied after the final documents have been signed due to the
						borrower using the wrong checking account for the down payment.</p>
					<p>Seasoning of the down payment money is just as important as the source, which is why underwriters
						typically require at least two months bank / asset statements in the initial mortgage approval
						process.</p>
					<p>A Few Acceptable Sources Of Down Payment Include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Bank Accounts – checking / savings</li>
						<li>Investment Accounts – money market, mutual funds</li>
						<li>Retirement Funds – keep in mind that borrowing against a 401K plan will require a repayment,
							which will be calculated in the Debt-to-Income Ratio</li>
						<li>Life Insurance – Cash value and face amount</li>
						<li>Gifts – Family members can gift down payment funds with certain restrictions</li>
						<li>Inheritance / Trust Funds</li>
						<li>Government Grants – Many state, county and city agencies offer special down payment
							assistance programs.</li>
