                    <h3>The Benefits Of A 20% Down Payment</h3>
                </button>
                <div class="content" id="flyer-3">
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Your interest rate will be lower.</strong><br /> Putting down a 20% down payment vs.
                            a 3-5% down payment shows your lender/bank that you are more financially stable, thus a good
                            credit risk. The more confident your bank
                            is in your credit score and your ability to pay your loan, the lower the rate they will be
                            willing to give you.</li>
                        <li><strong>You’ll end up paying less for your home.</strong><br /> The bigger your down
                            payment, the lower your loan amount will be for your mortgage. If you are able to pay 20% of
                            the cost of your new home at the start of the transaction,
                            you will only pay interest on the remaining 80%. If you put down a 5% down payment, the
                            extra 15% on your loan will accrue interest and end up costing you more in the long run!
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Your offer will stand out in a competitive market!</strong><br /> In a market where
                            many buyers are competing for the same home, sellers like to see offers come in with 20% or
                            larger down payments. The seller gains the
                            same confidence that the bank did above. You are seen as a stronger buyer whose financing is
                            more likely to be approved. Therefore, the deal will be more likely to go through!</li>
                        <li><strong>You won’t have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)</strong><br /> Simply put,
                            PMI is “an insurance policy that protects the lender if you are unable to pay your mortgage.
                            It’s a monthly fee, rolled into your mortgage
                            payment, that is required for all conforming, conventional loans that have down payments
                            less than 20%.”</li>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Providing proper asset documentation and the actual source of the funds is a critical element of
                        the loan closing process.</p>
                    <p>There’s nothing worse in a real estate purchase than making it all the way through the hoops and
                        hurdles just to have a loan denied after the final documents have been signed due to the
                        borrower using the wrong checking account for
                        the down payment.</p>
                    <p>Seasoning of the down payment money is just as important as the source, which is why underwriters
                        typically require at least two months bank / asset statements in the initial mortgage approval
                        process.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>A Few Acceptable Sources Of Down Payment Include:</h4>
                        <li>Bank Accounts – checking / savings</li>
                        <li>Investment Accounts – money market, mutual funds</li>
                        <li>Retirement Funds – keep in mind that borrowing against a 401K plan will require a repayment,
                            which will be calculated in the Debt-to-Income Ratio</li>
                        <li>Life Insurance – Cash value and face amount</li>
                        <li>Gifts – Family members can gift down payment funds with certain restrictions</li>
                        <li>Inheritance / Trust Funds</li>
                        <li>Government Grants – Many state, county and city agencies offer special down payment
                            assistance programs

                </button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>If you’ve heard of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you know the family of conventional loans. These
                        loans are
                        written by a wide range of banks, from your hometown locally owned to the fanciest mortgage
                        broker.
                        “Conforming” loans meet Fannie and Freddie’s high requirements, including maximum sales price.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Generally, you’ll get a better deal on mortgage insurance that
                        automatically drops
                        off (meaning you no longer have to pay it) once your home reaches a 78 percent loan to value
                        ratio. Also,
                        you’ll pay less in closing costs and your debt to income ratio can be somewhat flexible as long
                        as look
                        really good on paper.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> These are generally the hardest loans to qualify for. Even though there
                        are now
                        three to five percent down payment options, your credit score will need to be around 700 (better
                        is better)
                        and your other ducks should be lined up nice and straight. Consistent employment, savings that
                        can be
                        designated as “reserve funds” and few to no scabs on your credit report are helpful.</p>

                    <h3>FHA</h3>
                </button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The FHA started insuring loans after the Great Depression as a way of helping people get back
                        into owned property. It basically created the 30 year fixed interest mortgage and continues to
                        carefully oversee which homes can and cannot
                        be purchased in its name.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good option for first time buyers because of low down payment and credit
                        requirements. FHA will accept “soft” credit lines for people who haven’t established credit yet
                        or have very little, so keep that utility
                        bill paid on time. The program allows up to six percent of your closing costs to be financed
                        into your loan, as “seller paid items,” which can help reduce the actual cash you need to close.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> FHA requires a lot more in closing costs because of the additional upfront
                        mortgage insurance deposit. In addition, if you have less than a 10 percent down payment, under
                        the current programs you’ll be forced
                        to keep paying mortgage insurance for the life of the loan, giving you no options but to
                        refinance or sell down the line if you want rid of it (it’s costly, you want rid of it). Not
                        every banker wants to deal with FHA loans because
                        they can be time consuming to write, so you may have to shop a bit to find a good bank.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>As part of the benefits that active military members and veterans receive from the government, VA
                        loans are built on a merit-based system. Career military and those honorably discharged early
                        are generally eligible, but short-term
                        members or Reserves may have to meet additional requirements. Anyone who can get this loan will
                        need to bring a Certificate of Eligibility in order to get the ball rolling with an approved
                        lender.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Favorable interest rates, extremely flexible guidelines and absolutely
                        nothing required as a downpayment (often little to nothing required at closing!) There’s no
                        mortgage insurance, just a one time “funding
                        fee” that varies with your service type, downpayment and times you’ve used your Eligibility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Really, there aren’t any. You can’t get this if you’re not military,
                        though, so that could be a con if you really wanted this most excellent loan type.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>In rural areas, the US Department of Agriculture will offer mortgage lending as a way of helping
                        to keep the local economy flowing. Homes don’t have to be on an acreage, but they do need to be
                        located in communities with under 35,000
                        inhabitants.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Like VA, USDA are fairly easy to qualify for as the buyer. They can also
                        be zero down loans, though the more you can bring to closing the better. Payment assistance and
                        other types of help are sometimes available
                        for very low income borrowers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> The house you’re buying will undergo significant scrutiny in order to be
                        approved for the program. In all loan programs, your house has to qualify, but the hurdles USDA
                        puts in front of the building are much
                        larger than most other programs. This is good for you, because it means you’re getting a great
                        house, but it makes the process take a lot longer and can be scary for sellers. In addition,
                        there’s a cap on income for potential borrowers.</p>
